							The <b>${ SETTINGS["rdp.shortname"]} registry</b> collects information on model
							organism researchers and the specific genes they study. The
							registry is the mechanism by which the ${ SETTINGS["rdp.shortname"]} will find
							potential matches of model organism researchers to human rare
							disease researchers.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Registry collects two types of information. First, you will
							enter your basic contact information and some general information
							about your research (under "<a href="#"
								onclick='return utility.openAccordian($("#aboutcollapse1"))'>My
								Account</a>"). Second, you will enter information about genes you
							study, for one or more model organisms ("<a href="#"
								onclick='return utility.openAccordian($("#aboutcollapse2"))'>My
								Model Organisms</a>"). Obtaining a correct and comprehensive list of
							genes is of key interest. In order to assist registrants in this
							regard we devised a three-tier gene model described. Please
							<a href="#"
								onclick='return utility.openAccordian($("#aboutcollapse2-3"))'>read
								carefully</a> before you start adding genes to your profile.
						</p>

						<p>
							All information in the Registry is <a href="#" onclick='return utility.openAccordian($("#collapse4"))'>confidential</a> and will only be
							used by the Network administration for matching you to rare
							disease research projects. Your information will <i>never</i> be
							shared with any third party (including other registered
							researchers) without your consent.
						</p>

							<b>General help</b>: For many fields throughout the site, you
							will see an icon like this: <i class="fa fa-edit yellow-icon"></i>.
							Click on the icon to enable editing of the associated field. When
							you are done, click the icon again (which now looks like this: <i
								class="fa fa-check-square-o green-icon"></i>) to lock your
							edits.
