							The <b>RDMMN Registry</b> ("the Registry") is the mechanism by
							which the Network will find potential matches of model organism
							researchers to human rare disease researchers.
						</p>
						<p>The Registry collects two types of information:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Basic contact information and some general information
								about your research (under <i>"My Account"</i>).
							</li>
							<li>Information about genes you study, for one or more model
								organisms (under <i>"My Model Organisms"</i>).
							</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							All information in the Registry is confidential and will only be
							used by the Network administration for matching you to rare
							disease research projects. Your information will <i>never</i> be
							shared with any third party (including other registered
							researchers) without your consent.
						</p>

						<p>By having a complete Registry entry, you will maximize the
							chances that you will be contacted to apply for a Catalyst Grant.</p>

						<p>
							<b>General help</b>: For many fields throughout the site, you
