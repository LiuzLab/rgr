															big, too small or highly redundant with another candidate

										<p>Key to the success of the Network is our ability to
											match human disease genes to model organism researchers who
											can study those genes. We recognize that for any given human
											gene, there is a limited chance that a model organism
											researcher in Canada is actively studying that specific gene.
											Therefore we need to be able to cast a wider net. On the
											other hand, we must strike a balance between restricting the
											genes registered and assuming that every lab can study any
											gene.</p>
										<p>To reach this balance, genes are divided into Tiers:</p>
										<ul>
											<li><b>Tier 1 or "Primary" genes</b> are those you
												currently work on in a model organism. You must be able to
												immediately, specifically and rapidly study them in your
												laboratory. Genes you have recently published on are
												especially good Primary genes. We expect this to typically
												be between one and ten genes.</li>
											<li><b>Tier 2 genes</b> are those you do not mark as
												"Primary". Carefully choose genes which you are not
												necessarily actively investigating but would be able to work
												on rapidly and specifically with minimal set-up time. These
												might be paralogs of Tier 1 genes, or members of the same
												complexes or pathway. For most registrants we expect there
												might be between one and 100 non-Primary genes entered.</li>
											<li><b>Tier 3 genes</b> are not specifically selected by
												the registrant. Instead, we use Gene Ontology (GO) terms
												selected to infer them. By indicating the GO terms most
												related to your work, genes having those annotations will be
												considered as Tier 3 genes. There may be several hundred
												such genes.</li>
										</ul>
										<p>See also the question about "I study the entire
											genome".</p>

										<p>Remember that entering genes into the registry is only
											the first step in the Catalyst Granting process. For a given
											human gene needing a match, we will first look for
											registrants who list an ortholog as a Primary (Tier 1) gene.
											If no match is found, the other Tiers will be searched. If a
											gene you entered comes up and you are invited to apply for a
											Catalyst Grant, you will have to provide evidence of your
											readiness to study that gene. Keep that in mind as you select
											your genes.</p>
